It is recommended you run this demo in a conda environment. For example:

  conda create -n pygame-demo python=3.7 --yes
  conda activate pygame-demo
  conda install -c cogsci pygame --yes

This was tested on MacOSX, but it should work on other platforms as well.

This will set up the environment so you can then run them demo via:

  python pygame-demo.py
